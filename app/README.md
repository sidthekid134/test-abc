# FastAPI Application

This directory contains the main FastAPI application code.

## Structure

- `main.py`: Main application entry point with FastAPI route definitions
- `models.py`: SQLModel database models
- Additional modules as needed (services, dependencies, etc.)

## Usage

The application follows standard FastAPI patterns. To extend the application:

1. Add new models to `models.py`
2. Add new endpoints to `main.py`
3. Create additional modules as needed for complex functionality
