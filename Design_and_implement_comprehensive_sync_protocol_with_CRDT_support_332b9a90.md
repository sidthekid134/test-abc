# Design and implement comprehensive sync protocol with CRDT support

Story ID: 332b9a90-f340-4558-a569-d156f51eb88a
Intent: Scalable Real-time Sync Infrastructure
Run ID: 478d197d-93a7-451b-89cc-95e198f4ae53

## Acceptance Criteria
- Protocol specification document with versioning strategy and backward compatibility
- CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) implementation for text, lists, and maps
- Vector clock-based conflict resolution with last-writer-wins fallback
- Support for offline-first operations with eventual consistency guarantees
- Protocol buffer definitions for efficient binary serialization
- Comprehensive test suite covering conflict scenarios and edge cases
- Performance benchmarks showing <10ms conflict resolution time
- Documentation with examples for common collaboration patterns
